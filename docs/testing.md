# AI Model Testing and Validation

This document provides an overview of the testing and validation module of our AI model. The module is designed to ensure the quality and reliability of the model by validating the data and tracking the model's parameters, metrics, and artifacts.

## TensorFlow Data Validation (TFDV)

TensorFlow Data Validation (TFDV) is a library for exploring and validating machine learning data. It is designed to be highly scalable and to work well with TensorFlow and TensorFlow Extended (TFX).

In our project, we use TFDV to validate the data used for training the model. The `tf_data_validation` function in the `Testing` class takes a data file as input and validates the data against a predefined schema. The schema is defined using TensorFlow's `tf.io.FixedLenFeature` function, which specifies the type and shape of each feature in the data.

If the data does not conform to the schema, TFDV will identify and print the anomalies.

## Great Expectations

Great Expectations is a Python-based open-source library for validating, documenting, and profiling your data. It helps you to maintain data quality and improve communication about data between teams.

In our project, we use Great Expectations to test the data used for training the model. The `great_expectations_test` function in the `Testing` class takes a data batch as input and validates it against a set of predefined expectations. These expectations include checks like whether certain columns are not null and whether the values in a column are between certain limits.

The results of the validation are then printed.

## MLflow Tracking

MLflow Tracking is an API and UI for logging parameters, code versions, metrics, and output files when running your machine learning code and for later visualizing the results.

In our project, we use MLflow Tracking to track the parameters, metrics, and artifacts of the model. The `mlflow_track` function in the `Testing` class takes a parameter, a metric, and an artifact as input and logs them using MLflow's `log_param`, `log_metric`, and `log_artifacts` functions respectively.

## Unit Tests

Unit tests are written to ensure that the functions in the `Testing` class work as expected. The tests use the `unittest` module in Python and mock the necessary functions to isolate the function being tested. The tests can be found in the `tests/test_testing.py` file.

## Conclusion

Testing and validation are crucial steps in the development of an AI model. They ensure that the model is working as expected and that the data used for training the model is of high quality. By using tools like TFDV, Great Expectations, and MLflow Tracking, we can automate these processes and ensure the reliability and robustness of our model.
