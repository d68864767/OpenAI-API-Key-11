# AI Model Orchestration and Workflow

This document provides an overview of the orchestration and workflow management for AI models in our project. We use Apache Airflow, Kubeflow Pipelines, and Apache NiFi for managing the workflow of our AI models.

## Apache Airflow

Apache Airflow is a platform to programmatically author, schedule and monitor workflows. In our project, we use Airflow to define a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) for our model training and deployment pipeline. Each task in the pipeline is represented as a PythonOperator in Airflow.

Here is a snippet from our code that shows how we define a DAG and its tasks in Airflow:

```python
dag = DAG('model_pipeline', description='A pipeline to train and deploy AI model',
          schedule_interval='0 12 * * *',
          start_date=datetime(2021, 1, 1), catchup=False)

task_operators = {task_name: PythonOperator(task_id=task_name, python_callable=task_func, dag=dag) for task_name, task_func in tasks.items()}
```

## Kubeflow Pipelines

Kubeflow Pipelines is a platform for building and deploying portable, scalable machine learning (ML) workflows based on Docker containers. We use Kubeflow Pipelines to define a pipeline for our model training and deployment tasks.

Here is a snippet from our code that shows how we define a pipeline in Kubeflow Pipelines:

```python
pipeline_func = dsl.pipeline(
    name='model_pipeline',
    description='A pipeline to train and deploy AI model'
)(pipeline_func)
compiler.Compiler().compile(pipeline_func, 'model_pipeline.zip')
```

## Apache NiFi

Apache NiFi is an easy to use, powerful, and reliable system to process and distribute data. We use NiFi to orchestrate data flow for our AI models.

Here is a snippet from our code that shows how we use NiFi to orchestrate data flow:

```python
nifi = NiFi(host=host, port=port)
process_group = nifi.pg.get(process_group_id)
```

## Testing

We use the unittest framework in Python to test our orchestration code. We use mocking to isolate the code under test and to ensure that our tests run quickly.

Here is a snippet from our test code:

```python
class TestOrchestration(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.model = MagicMock()
        self.orchestration = Orchestration(self.model)
```
