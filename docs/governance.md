# AI Model Governance and Compliance

This document provides an overview of the AI Model Governance and Compliance module of our project. The module is implemented in the `src/governance.py` file and tested in the `tests/test_governance.py` file.

## Overview

The Governance module is responsible for ensuring that the AI model adheres to the necessary compliance and governance standards. It uses the ModelDB, DataRobot MLOps, and OpenAI GPT-3 Compliance Features to achieve this.

## Implementation

The Governance class is initialized with a model. It sets up a new syncer object for ModelDB and a MLOps object for DataRobot.

### ModelDB Governance

The `modeldb_governance` method is used to govern the model using ModelDB. It logs the training data, the model, and the prediction to ModelDB.

### DataRobot Governance

The `datarobot_governance` method is used to govern the model using DataRobot MLOps. It reports the deployment stats to DataRobot MLOps.

### OpenAI Governance

The `openai_governance` method is used to govern the model using OpenAI GPT-3 Compliance Features. It creates a compliance document using the provided text.

## Testing

The Governance module is tested in the `tests/test_governance.py` file. The tests use the unittest framework and mock objects to test the functionality of the Governance class.

### Test ModelDB Governance

The `test_modeldb_governance` method tests the `modeldb_governance` method of the Governance class. It checks that the necessary ModelDB methods are called with the correct arguments.

### Test DataRobot Governance

The `test_datarobot_governance` method tests the `datarobot_governance` method of the Governance class. It checks that the `report_deployment_stats` method of the MLOps class is called with the correct arguments.

### Test OpenAI Governance

The `test_openai_governance` method tests the `openai_governance` method of the Governance class. It checks that the `create` method of the Compliance class is called with the correct arguments.
