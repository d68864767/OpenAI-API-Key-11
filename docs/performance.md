# Performance Optimization

This document provides an overview of the performance optimization techniques implemented in our AI model. The main focus is on GPU acceleration, distributed training, model quantization, and model pruning.

## GPU Acceleration

GPU acceleration is a technique that uses a graphics processing unit (GPU) together with a CPU to accelerate deep learning, analytics, and engineering applications. This technique is implemented in the `gpu_acceleration` function in the `Performance` class. The function checks if a GPU is available and if so, moves the model to the GPU.

```python
def gpu_acceleration(self):
    """
    Function to enable GPU acceleration
    """
    if torch.cuda.is_available():
        self.model = self.model.cuda()
```

## Distributed Training

Distributed training is a technique that allows us to train a model on multiple GPUs. This is implemented in the `distributed_training` function in the `Performance` class. The function checks if multiple GPUs are available and if so, wraps the model in `nn.DataParallel` for distributed training.

```python
def distributed_training(self, data, target):
    """
    Function to perform distributed training
    """
    if torch.cuda.device_count() > 1:
        self.model = nn.DataParallel(self.model)
    self.model = self.model.to(device)
    data, target = data.to(device), target.to(device)
```

## Model Quantization

Model quantization is a technique that allows for reducing the memory footprint of a model and its computational requirements. This is implemented in the `model_quantization` function in the `Performance` class. The function quantizes the model using PyTorch's dynamic quantization.

```python
def model_quantization(self):
    """
    Function to perform model quantization
    """
    quantized_model = torch.quantization.quantize_dynamic(
        self.model, {nn.Linear}, dtype=torch.qint8
    )
    return quantized_model
```

## Model Pruning

Model pruning is a technique that allows for reducing the size of a model by removing unnecessary parameters. This is implemented in the `model_pruning` function in the `Performance` class. The function prunes the model using PyTorch's pruning utilities.

```python
def model_pruning(self, amount=0.5):
    """
    Function to perform model pruning
    """
    parameters_to_prune = (
        (self.model.conv1, 'weight'),
        (self.model.conv2, 'weight'),
        (self.model.fc1, 'weight'),
        (self.model.fc2, 'weight'),
    )

    torch.nn.utils.prune.global_unstructured(
        parameters_to_prune,
        pruning_method=torch.nn.utils.prune.L1Unstructured,
        amount=amount,
    )
```
