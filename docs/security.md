# AI Model Security and Access Control

This document provides an overview of the security and access control measures implemented in our AI model. The `Security` class in `src/security.py` is responsible for managing these measures.

## AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)

The `aws_iam` method is used to manage AWS IAM policies. It creates a new policy with the given policy name, policy document, description, and path. If an error occurs during the creation of the policy, it is caught and printed to the console.

## Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

The `azure_rbac` method is used to manage Azure RBAC roles. It retrieves a token for the given role name. If an error occurs during the retrieval of the token, it is caught and printed to the console.

## Google Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM)

The `google_iam` method is used to manage Google IAM policies. It retrieves the IAM policy for the given policy name. If an error occurs during the retrieval of the policy, it is caught and printed to the console.

## HashiCorp Vault Secrets Management

The `hashicorp_vault` method is used to manage HashiCorp Vault secrets. It reads the secret at the given secret path. If an error occurs during the reading of the secret, it is caught and printed to the console.

## Testing

The `tests/test_security.py` file contains unit tests for the `Security` class. Each method in the class has a corresponding test method in the test file. The test methods use the `unittest.mock` library to mock the responses of the AWS, Azure, Google, and HashiCorp Vault clients. If the method under test calls the mocked method at least once and does not return `None`, the test passes.

## Conclusion

The `Security` class provides a comprehensive set of methods for managing the security and access control measures of our AI model. By leveraging the capabilities of AWS IAM, Azure RBAC, Google IAM, and HashiCorp Vault, we can ensure that our model is secure and that access to it is strictly controlled.
