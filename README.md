# AI Model Management System

This project provides a comprehensive suite of tools and strategies for managing AI models throughout their lifecycle. It covers everything from model explainability and fairness to monitoring, debugging, testing, governance, collaboration, experimentation, documentation, ethics, performance optimization, security, deployment, orchestration, and state management.

## Modules

Each aspect of AI model management is handled by a separate module in the `src` directory. Here is a brief overview of what each module does:

- `explainability.py`: Implements SHAP, Lime, Captum, and InterpretML for AI model explainability and interpretability.
- `fairness.py`: Uses Fairlearn, AI Fairness 360, Themis, and AuditAI for AI model fairness and bias mitigation.
- `monitoring.py`: Utilizes Prometheus, Grafana, DataDog, and New Relic for AI model monitoring and alerting.
- `debugging.py`: Employs TensorBoard Debugger, PyTorch Profiler, TensorFlow Debugger, and MLflow Tracking for AI model debugging and profiling.
- `testing.py`: Applies TensorFlow Data Validation (TFDV), Great Expectations, TFX (TensorFlow Extended), and MLflow Projects for AI model testing and validation.
- `governance.py`: Enforces ModelDB Governance, DataRobot MLOps Governance, OpenAI GPT-3 Compliance Features, and Ethical AI Consultation Services for AI model governance and compliance.
- `collaboration.py`: Facilitates Git Version Control, GitHub Collaboration, GitLab CI/CD Pipelines, and Bitbucket Repository Management for AI model collaboration and version control.
- `experimentation.py`: Manages Google Cloud AI Platform Experiments, DVC (Data Version Control), H2O.ai Driverless AI, and MLflow Experiments for AI model experimentation and evaluation.
- `documentation.py`: Uses Sphinx Documentation, Jupyter Notebook Documentation, Confluence Documentation, and Read the Docs for AI model documentation platforms.
- `ethics.py`: Handles compliance auditing, AI regulation compliance, and ethical AI guidelines for AI model ethics and compliance.
- `performance.py`: Optimizes with cloud GPU acceleration, distributed training, model quantization, and model pruning techniques for AI model performance.
- `security.py`: Secures with AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Google Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM), HashiCorp Vault Secrets Management, and secure model deployment practices for AI model security and access control.
- `deployment.py`: Deploys with TensorFlow Serving, ONNX Runtime, Nvidia Triton Inference Server, model deployment best practices, and multi-model serving strategies for AI model deployment and serving.
- `orchestration.py`: Orchestrates with Apache Airflow for ML Pipelines, Kubeflow Pipelines, Apache NiFi for Data Flow, and AI model orchestration strategies for AI model orchestration and workflow.
- `state_management.py`: Manages model checkpointing, model version control, model snapshot strategies, and model migrations for AI model state management and versioning.

## Documentation

Each module has a corresponding documentation file in the `docs` directory. These files provide more detailed information about how each module works and how to use it.

## Tests

The `tests` directory contains unit tests for each module. Run these tests to verify that the modules are working correctly.

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To use a module, import it and call its functions. For example:

```python
from src import explainability

# Use the module's functions here
```
